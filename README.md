# Sprint 3 Project: Harmonizing Success: A Data-Driven Approach to Expanding Dilaw's Reach and Impact
We are the team **Three-Beats**! We are a group of individuals from diverse backgrounds who came together as part of the Eskwelabs Data Science Cohort 11. In our third sprint, we collaborated to create a data-driven presentation on recommender engines entitled **Harmonizing Success: A Data-Driven Approach to Expanding Dilaw's Reach and Impact**.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Dilaw can improve their music's impact by diversifying their music features while sticking to their sound and exploring similar audio features. By collaborating with Hale, Moonstar88, SUD, Zack Tabudlo, Moira dela Torre, and Ben&Ben, they can expand their audience reach based on a 60% accurate recommendation from the random forest algorithm. Additionally, strategic release dates based on time series analytics suggest January, April, and September as preferred months for album releases.
